# TravelCatalogue

Welcome to the Travel Catalogue! This is my first stab at building a full-stack application from scratch using my new-found software skills.

I decided to do something lighthearted and fun, and in line with my personal interest. I've always enjoyed travelling, but I always rued the fact that I fail to document the memories of my travels. I am a firm believer that reflecting on memories is important in life, and a great way to preserve them for the future. I thought I'd thus create a Travel Catalogue application that encourages such recording of memories, reflection, and of course, a social aspect to share with your family and loved ones.

## Getting Started

This game runs on a web browser, and requires Javascript to be enabled.

### Prerequisites

As long as you have a web browser (who doesn't have one?!), you're all set!

### Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Materialize, Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS to build this product. These are the skills picked up over the past 12 weeks at my General Assembly Software Engineering course!

## Approach Taken

The approach I took was as follows:

1. Determine overall structure of the site - concept, MVC model
2. Set up MVC baseline documents, and built out the data model individually
3. Built server.js and the individual controller files with the 7 restful API routes and CRUD functionality
4. Built view pages (basic form)
5. Integrated 2 data models together
6. Built login/logout functionality and included sessions controller
7. Incorporated style elements using Materialize
8. Tested functionality and fixed bugs
9. Refactor code for readability and future enhancements (set up partials folder and linked all view pages to partials)

In terms of future development, I plan to work on the following features:

1. Include photo upload functionality
2. Include restricted viewing capabilities based on user tags
